Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain quality software systems.
Software Engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software systems that power communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare which are important aspects of modern life.
For example, by developing business tailored solutions, companies can optimise their operations. For businesses, software engineering helps businesses manage data efficiently. Software engineering enables for the adoption of technological solutions in various sectors such as in business processes and agriculture which results to growth not only in the sectors that adopt the solutions but also enhances growth in the technological industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages. This made programming more efficient due to the development of high-level languages. 
The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline. 
The advent of structured programming. The use of control structures like loops and conditional statements improved on code clarity, readability and maintainability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements gathering. gathering and documenting user needs and defining system requirements.
2. Design phase. Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation phase. Implementation of the design and writing of code.
4. Testing phase. Conducting tests to ensure the developed product meets quality standards and defined functional requirements.
5. Deployment phase. Releasing of a functional software product to the users or customers.
6. Maintenance phase. Developers continue to provide support, perform updates and enhance the software as required after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
